# 🧠 Concept Extraction Tool for Competitive Exams  
**Roll Number:** 23B0652  
**Name:** Parv Seth  

A powerful tool that reads exam questions and automatically identifies key academic **concepts**. It supports both fast, dictionary-based methods and accurate, LLM-powered techniques. Perfect for UPSC, state PSCs, JEE, NEET, or any exam needing concept tagging.

---
### Prompt Used for testing : 
Give me the: key historical, cultural, or subject-related concepts present in the following question. Focus only on named entities, terminology, historical references, philosophical ideas, or subject-matter concepts that the question is testing knowledge of

## 📖 Overview

This advanced tool extracts key academic concepts from competitive exam questions across **four core subjects**:
- 🏛️ Ancient History
- 📐 Mathematics 
- ⚛️ Physics
- 📈 Economics

The system implements a **dual-layer extraction architecture**:
1. ⚡ **Keyword-based extraction** (Fast, deterministic)
2. 🤖 **LLM API-based extraction** (Context-aware, semantic)

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Multi-Subject Support** | Domain-specific keyword dictionaries + subject detection | Handles diverse question types |
| **Hybrid Extraction** | Fallback from LLM to keyword-based | Ensures 100% uptime |
| **Context Preservation** | Subject-specific prompt engineering | Saves new concepts |
| **Duplicate Detection** | Question fingerprinting | Prevents database pollution |
| **Statistical Analysis** | Concept frequency distribution | Reveals exam patterns |
| **Interactive Mode** | Command line input with live tagging | Great for debugging or tutoring |
| **Bulk Processing** | CLI-based batch mode | Processes too questions|

## 🌟 Plain English Explanation  
This is like a "smart highlighter" for exam questions that:  
1. **Reads** questions from files (History, Math, Physics, Economics)  
2. **Finds** the main topics being tested  
3. **Organizes** them for better study planning  

> 💡 **Example:**  
> *Input Question:* "What was Ashoka's Dhamma policy?"  
> *Output Concepts:* "Mauryan Empire; Buddhist Philosophy"  

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive  

### 🔧 How It Works  
1. **Keyword Brain** (Fast Mode)  
   - Uses a dictionary of 50+ important terms  
   - Example: "harappan" → "Indus Valley Civilization"  
## Usage

2. **Basic Usage**
```bash
# Process ancient history questions
python main.py --subject=ancient_history

# Use API for extraction (requires API key)
python main.py --subject=math --use-api

# Include concept distribution analysis
python main.py --subject=physics --analyze

#Include interactive mode in which you can add new questions that directly gets added to the output csv file and concepts are also extracted
python main.py --interactive --subject=ancient_history
```

3. **Examples of outputs**

5. **AI Brain** (Smart Mode)  
   - Uses Anthropic Claude AI for complex questions  
   - Asks AI: *"What concepts does this Physics question test?"*  

6. **Safety Net**  
   - If AI fails, automatically switches to keyword mode

## 🚀 How to Use It  

### For Non-Tech Users  
1. Put questions in `physics.csv` (or other subject files)  
2. Run:  
   python main.py --subject=physics
Get output_concepts.csv with all topics identified

For Developers
```
# Want to use OpenAI instead? Just edit:
def call_llm(prompt):
    return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role":"user","content":prompt}]
    )
``` 
💡 Why This Stands Out
For Students
Shows which topics appear most often in past exams
Helps focus study time effectively
For Teachers
Automatically analyzes 100+ questions in minutes

Generates reports like:
Top Tested Concepts:  
1. Newton's Laws (23%)  
2. Thermodynamics (18%)

🚨 Limitations
Currently handles ~50 concepts per subject
Works best with clear, well-formatted questions
AI mode requires internet connection

📈 Future Improvements
Add more subjects (Chemistry, Biology)
Include example solutions for each concept
